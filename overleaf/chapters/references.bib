Key stakeholders who were involved in leading this effort participated in focus groups, as well as individual interviews. Archival documentation was also used. Findings indicate implementation of STEM policy in this state experienced some barriers because of the nature of funding and timeline, as well as the competing agendas and interests of partners who did not have the opportunity to develop common vision and strategic plans prior to implementation. Implications for STEM policy decisions and implementation of other efforts through Race to the Top and other federal funding sources are discussed.},

	abstract = {In 1985 the Media Lab was created at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] to advance the idea that computation would give rise to a new science of expressive media. Within the Media Lab, the Epistemology \& Learning Group, directed by Seymour Papert, extends the traditional definition of media by treating as expressive media materials with which children play and learn. The group's work follows Papert's paradigm for learning research called Constructionism. Several of the chapters directly address the theoretical formulations of Constructionism, and others describe experimental studies which enrich and confirm different aspects of the idea. Thus this volume can be taken as the most extensive and definitive statement to date of this approach to media and education research and practice. The book is structured around four major themes: learning through design and programming; epistemological styles in constructionist learning; children and cybernetics; [and] video as a research tool.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Learning through play has emerged as an important strategy to promote student engagement, inclusion, and holistic skills development beyond the preschool years. Policy makers, researchers and educators have promoted the notion that learning though play is developmentally appropriate—as it leverages school-age children’s innate curiosity while easing the often difficult transition from preschool to school. However, there is a dearth of evidence and practical guidance on how learning through play can be employed effectively in the formal school context, and the conditions that support success. This paper addresses the disconnect between policy, research and practice by presenting a range of empirical studies across a number of well-known pedagogies. These studies describe how children can foster cognitive, social, emotional, creative and physical skills through active engagement in learning that is experienced as joyful, meaningful, socially interactive, actively engaging and iterative. The authors propose an expanded definition for learning through play at school based on the science of learning, and summarize key findings from international studies on the impact of children’s learning through play. They identify four key challenges that underpin the considerable gap between education policy and practice, and propose a useful framework that addresses these challenges {\textless}italic{\textgreater}via{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} a common language and structure to implement learning through play.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It has been explored in various contexts and in different phases of schooling, from primary to higher education. The majority of the reviewed studies were based on a quasi-experimental pretest–posttest design with some baseline equivalence established but no random allocation of participants to control and experimental groups, and as a result, a causal link between PBL instruction and positive student outcomes cannot be established with certainty. Modern digital technology, group processes of high quality, teachers’ ability to effectively scaffold students’ learning and provide guidance and support, the balance between didactic instruction with in-depth inquiry methods and well-aligned assessment have been identified in the literature as facilitating factors in the implementation of PBL. The article concludes with six key recommendations considered to be essential for the successful adoption of a PBL approach in the mainstream school setting.},

	abstract = {The aim of this multiple-case study was to research the key characteristics of project-based learning (PBL) and how teachers implement them within the context of science education. K-12 science teachers and their students’ videos, learning diaries and online questionnaire answers about their biology related PBL units, within the theme nature and environment, were analysed using deductive and inductive content analysis (n = 12 schools). The studied teachers are actively engaged in PBL as the schools had participated voluntarily in the international StarT programme of LUMA Centre Finland. The results indicate that PBL may specifically promote the use of collaboration, artefacts, technological tools, problem-centredness, and certain scientific practices, such as carrying out research, presenting results, and reflection within science education. However, it appeared that driving questions, learning goals set by students, students’ questions, the integrity of the project activities, and using the projects as a means to learn central content, may be more challenging to implement. Furthermore, although scientific practices had a strong role in the projects, it could not be defined how strongly student-led the inquiries were. The study also indicated that students and teachers may pay attention to different aspects of learning that happen through PBL. The results contribute towards a deeper understanding of the possibilities and challenges related to implementation of PBL and using scientific practices in classrooms. Furthermore, the results and the constructed framework of key characteristics can be useful in promoting research-based implementation and design of PBL science education, and in teacher training related to it.},

The question that this paper seeks to answer is what it is about these activities that fosters student learning. In a review of the literature, three factors have been identified as making a significant contribution to this strategy's success. They are peer interaction through cooperative learning, object-mediated learning and embodied experience. By taking these factors into account, teachers of Science can design lessons that explicitly utilise this knowledge.},

	abstract = {Educational robotics (ER) nowadays is booming at the research and educational level while more and more teachers and schools are introducing robotics as a core activity in school classrooms to teach Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). However, despite the growing research interest and efforts in educational robotics, it seems that enough attention has not been paid to important factors like guidance and collaboration scripts, which are significant elements of the ER curricula. At the same time, there are many ER systems in the literature that have not been used extensively, and therefore they are mostly unknown to the related community. Furthermore, factors such as age and gender, which should be taken into consideration for the selection for the most appropriate ER system, seem to be ignored. Therefore, on the one hand, the existing curricula do not fully support teachers and learners, preventing educational robotics to become a truly effective tool in teachers’ hands. On the other hand, teachers do not seem to be fully aware of the available robotic design technologies and principles, in order to make the right choices for their students.},

In this article, we review and discuss current research on STEM education in the United States, drawing on recent research in sociology and related fields. The reviewed literature shows that different social factors affect the two major components of STEM education attainment: (a) attainment of education in general, and (b) attainment of STEM education relative to non-STEM education conditional on educational attainment. Cognitive and social-psychological characteristics matter for both components, as do structural influences at the family, neighborhood, school, and broader cultural levels. However, whereas commonly used measures of socioeconomic status (SES) predict the attainment of general education, social-psychological factors are more important influences on participation and achievement in STEM versus non-STEM education. Domestically, disparities by family SES, race, and gender persist in STEM education. Internationally, American students lag behind those in some countries with fewer economic resources. Explanations for group disparities within the United States and the mediocre international ranking of US student performance require more research, a task that is best accomplished through interdisciplinary approaches.},

This study followed a quasi-experimental research method. Bandura’s social cognitive theory is used to assess and compare the effect of STEM PjBL with conventional teaching method on students’ self-efficacy level in learning physics among over 100 high school students. The result illustrated that STEM PjBL improve students’ self-efficacy to solve physics problem. Also, the study proposes a guideline for future research.\&nbsp;},

The dominant engineering pedagogy remains “chalk and talk”; despite research evidence that demonstrates its ineffectiveness. Such pedagogical approaches do not embrace the possibilities provided by more student-centric approaches and more active learning. The paper argues that there is a potential confusion in engineering education around the role of active learning approaches, and that the adoption of these approaches may be limited as a result of this confusion, combined with a degree of disciplinary egocentrism. The paper presents examples of design, engineering and technology projects that demonstrate the effectiveness of adopting pedagogies and delivery methods more usually attributed to the liberal arts such as studio based learning. The paper concludes with some suggestions about how best to create a fertile environment from which inquiry based learning can emerge as well as a reflection on whether the only real limitation on cultivating such approaches is the disciplinary egocentrism of traditional engineering educators.},

	abstract = {Improving science education is often regarded as a priority for developing countries in order to promote longterm economic development. Thus initiatives, both government and foreign-aid sponsored, aimed at improving science education in developing countries abound. However, all too often the focus of such initiatives is limited to the development of science curricula, while the details of how the curricula will be implemented at school level are often neglected. This paper represents an effort to lay the groundwork for a theory of curriculum implementation with particular reference to developing countries. We have drawn on school development, educational change, and science education literature in order to develop three constructs that could form the heart of such a theory, namely, Profile of Implementation, Capacity to Innovate, and Outside Support. Six propositions are offered to suggest how the constructs may inter-relate as a basis for the development of the theory. The implementation of the natural sciences learning area of the South African Curriculum 2005 is used to illustrate the emerging theory.},

A spirited defense of science . . . From the first page to the last, this book is a manifesto for clear thought.”—Los Angeles Times How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don’t understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience, New Age thinking, and fundamentalist zealotry and the testable hypotheses of science? Casting a wide net through history and culture, Pulitzer Prize–winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions. He examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies as witchcraft, faith healings, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today’s so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning, with stories of alien abduction, “channeling” past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect.  As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.},

              Decades of research demonstrate that a strong curricular approach to preschool education is important for later developmental outcomes. Although these findings have often been used to support the implementation of educational programs based on direct instruction, we argue that
              guided play
              approaches can be equally effective at delivering content and are more developmentally appropriate in their focus on child‐centered exploration. Guided play lies midway between direct instruction and free play, presenting a learning goal, and scaffolding the environment while allowing children to maintain a large degree of control over their learning. The evidence suggests that such approaches often outperform direct‐instruction approaches in encouraging a variety of positive academic outcomes. We argue that guided play approaches are effective because they create learning situations that encourage children to become  active and engaged partners in the learning process.},

	abstract = {The United Nations (UN) has launched several initiatives to promote the role of education in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and set Goal 4 for quality education among other SDGs. The integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) approach is a promising educational framework for sustainable development that improves education quality. In this study, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to evaluate the scientific results of the role of integrated STEM education specifically in improving the quality of education (SDG 4). A hundred and fifty publications, with an increasing trend in the number of documents each year, out of the total number of 74,879 documents related to “education quality” and 5,430 documents related to “STEM education” were chosen from the SCOPUS database. The study analyzes the growth and development of research activities in the area of “STEM education” and “Quality education” as reflected in the publications output in the time span of 27 years from 1993 to 2020. The publication and citation trends, the most frequently used keywords, the most influential authors and journals, and the research hotspots were investigated using VoSviewer and Bibliometrix software. Accordingly, the United States happened to be the most productive country in this field owning two-thirds of the number of publications. The “Science Education” journal is ranked at the top of the highly cited journals. The findings show that topics such as “early childhood education”, “computing education”, and “environmental education” are the main hotspots in the research area of STEM and quality of education. The results of this study will help enhance the understanding of integrated STEM education in improving the quality of education and will support future works in this area.},

	abstract = {Smart Motors is a low-cost, low-barrier-to-entry trainable robotic system enabling playful learning with technology in various classroom types. Many kits and online tools have been developed as educational resources for children to learn about robotics, enabling an increasingly widespread integration of engineering and robotics into classrooms. Despite the positive features of many existing technologies, however, issues of equitable access for students in under-resourced classrooms have emerged: the high costs of many of the kits and the need for internet connectivity, computers, and technical expertise on the part of teachers all limit their adoption. Smart Motors offers a low-cost solution based on readily available materials, enabling students in diverse educational contexts and ages to gain exposure to robotics and artificial intelligence. Users can train this type of motor to run to various positions corresponding to different sensor inputs, enabling students to bring their engineering projects to life. The underlying shift from coding to training robots eliminates the need for access to computers and the internet for students to engage in hands-on robotics activities. Furthermore, the system can be developed with locally available materials, enabling its adoption in diverse and international settings. In this paper, we describe the international collaboration in developing Smart Motors, detail various prototypes built with locally on-hand materials, describe the issues we have faced in this endeavor, and outline future plans. We are creating an international community of engineers and educators developing new designs and testing various materials available in local settings. This global network enables a wide range of educational contexts to be at the core of the development process. Studying students' engagement with the system at workshops further ensures that the product is accessible and contributes to students' and teachers' learning in various settings.},

	abstract = {Educational Robotics has gained popularity in K-12 education as an effective tool to teach STEM topics and skills like computational thinking, programming, collaboration, and creativity. With rapid technological progress, educational robots have found ways into classrooms worldwide. However, challenges like the ease of use, cost, and requiring specialized skills to operate and teach using these tools have hindered widespread adoption. In this dissertation, I present Smart Motors, a trainable educational robotics system, as a solution to these accessibility issues. By shifting from programming strategy to training, Smart Motors eliminates the need for computers and the internet to produce desired outcomes. Iterating through a series of improvements in design and components, we built a trainable robotics kit under \$30. Smart Motors were used in several workshops and classrooms in different countries, and the results show that they can be integrated into STEM classrooms with students from second grade to high school. I present three proof of concept studies using three Smart Motors prototypes with different age groups in different settings from engineering design and arts to science investigation in order to show Smart Motors effectively fulfills the learning objectives. The usability tests on one of the prototypes with 7 to 15-year-old participants showed how they could discover the training features independently. It also showed that Smart Motors are highly likable and capable of producing diverse solutions quickly. Investigation of playful learning experience characteristics, while engaging in a play-based activity with Smart Motors, revealed that Smart Motors supports playful learning. Through collaboration with partners in the US, Brazil, and Nepal, we have created Smart Motors resources for teachers to introduce educational robotics in their STEM classrooms.},
