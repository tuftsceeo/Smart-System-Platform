Road-map for further development, specific thesis suggestions. 

Use of smart system platform not just as a proof of concept, but for educational experience design. 

Develop the software and hardware further with regards to specific aspects, usability, and other

Community building and Outreach

Further development: connect webpage to data analysis website

Design some educational activities using the designed approach and networking.

Make an app version to program, configure and interact with the 

Further develop the configuration page, in one way create a version of the configuration page in which one could drag and drop modules and connect them with lines to define the interaction.

Further develop the LLM enabled configuration, have an interace in which one only describes the desired interaction, while the LLM parses this and returns the require command code or sends the appropriate command directly to correctly configures the modules that way.

This thesis focused mainly on giving tools to educational academic and college students, what happens if one gave access to these tools to educators or K-12 students? In what way would the UI need to be adapted, could the system be made intuitive enough for K-12 students to understand and/or educators to be able to quickly design and deploy a custom or pre-defined system to aid their lesson science education?

Is it possible and if so how could a community be built to sustain and continue development on an open-source basis of this system?

The whole thing is an MVP.

What are some other modules that could be developed? Ideas and questions below.
