As part of my master's thesis I am developing the Smart System Platform (SSP), which is building up on the existing Smart Motors Project and aims to develop it further for more wide-spread application. The goal is to develop an educational platform which can not only be used to teach certain science and engineering principles intuitively out of the box, but also to enable educators and academia to build lessons and prototype using said platform.
As you are either participating in the SSP-Hackathon or have used some of the developed tools in a different context, I would like to ask you some questions for my research to gather feedback on said tools for future improvement. 
The survey by itself will take about five minutes of your time. If you are participating in the Hackathon, you will first be given a brief introduction about the SSP, you will then be asked to split into groups and develop a small project using the SSP hardware and development tools, after which you will then present your project to the group and share some feedback. Afterwards you will then be given some time to filling out this survey. The Hackathon including this survey will take 60 minutes of your time.

It’s your decision, and there are no consequences to not participating. I further don’t anticipate any major risks to participation. If at any time during the form you do not want to answer a question, you can skip it. If at any time you want to stop participating, or you don’t want to start at all, you may feel free to quit the survey. Before submitting the survey, none of the information will be saved. 


The content of this survey may be used in publications or presentations, however identifiable information about you will not be shared beyond the research team. Your privacy is our top priority, but there is always a slight chance that someone could find out about your participation in this survey. People responsible for monitoring this research may be able to access the data. This includes the Tufts University IRB. Below you can find my contact information and the contact information of the research oversight board at Tufts, the Tufts SBER IRB, if you need to get in touch about this research at any point in the future.

I found myself switching between tabs a lot and trying to retain information between them can cause excess cognitive load (however I am operating on limited sleep so more sensitized to increased cognitive load than my average). So I would like the network manager to send information about my network to help inform the chat based coding assistant about the state of my network (e.g. number of devices, Mac addresses, etc, etc). Do the modules report to the network manager about their capacity/sensors/ports/libraries?
